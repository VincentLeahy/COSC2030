# Instructions  

Write a program that uses a structure to store the following weather data for a particular month:

* Total Rainfall
* High Temperature
* Low Temperature
* Average Temperature

The program should have an array of 12 structures to hold weather data for an enire year. When the program runs, it should ask the user to enter data for each month. (The average temperature should be calculated.) Once the data are entered for all the months, the program should calculate and display the average monthly rainfall, the total rainfall for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the year (and the months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly average temperatures.

_Input Validation: Only accept temperatures within the range between -100 and +140 degrees Fahrenheit._
